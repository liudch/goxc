goxc
====

goxc cross-compiles Go programs to (up to) 9 target platforms at once.

goxc is written in Go but uses *os.exec()* to call 'go build' with the appropriate flags & env variables for each supported platform.

goxc was inspired by Dave Cheney's Bash script [golang-crosscompile](https://github.com/davecheney/golang-crosscompile).
BUT, goxc crosscompiles to all platforms at once. The artifacts are saved into a folder structure along with a markdown file of relative links.

Pre-requisites
--------------
At this stage you still need to:

 1. Preferably use Linux (I haven't tested on other platforms)
 2. Download the go source code and set up the GOROOT accordingly.
 3. Download goxc below for your platform and place it on your system's [PATH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_%28variable%29)

Downloads
---------
[Latest binaries](http://laher.github.com/goxc/dl/latest/) for Linux, Mac, Windows.

Basic Usage
-----------

### Run once:

To build the toolchains for all 9 platforms:

       goxc -t

### Now build your artifacts

To build binaries for your app:

       cd path/to/app/folder
       goxc .

### Going further

See 'goxc -h' for more options.

Note that if running from source, replace 'goxc' with 'go run goxc.go'

Outcome
-------

Artifacts generated into a folder structure as follows:

 (outputfolder)/(version)/(OS)_(ARCH)/(appname)(.exe?)

e.g. /my/outputfolder/latest/linux_arm/myapp

By default, the output folder is ($GOBIN)/(appname)-xc, and the version is 'latest', but you can specify these.

e.g.

      goxc -av=0.1 -d=/home/me/myapp/ghpages/downloads/ .

Limitations
-----------

 * Currently there's a bug meaning you can only run goxc on the current folder.
 * Only tested on Linux. No idea if it would work on Win/Mac/FreeBSD
 * Currently goxc is only designed to build standalone Go apps without linked libraries. You can try but YMMV

Todo
----

 * Fix bug to allow building of a different directory (other than current working directory)
 * 'specify artifact folder' option
 * 'specify version name' option
 * 'generate Downloads page' option
 * 'download golang source' option?
 * building .so/.dll shared libraries?
