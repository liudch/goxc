goxc
====

[goxc](http://www.laher.net.nz/goxc) cross-compiles Go programs to (up to) 11 target platforms at once.

goxc is written in Go but uses *os.exec* to call 'go build' with the appropriate flags & env variables for each supported platform.

goxc was inspired by Dave Cheney's Bash script [golang-crosscompile](https://github.com/davecheney/golang-crosscompile).
BUT, goxc crosscompiles to all platforms at once. The artifacts are saved into a folder structure along with a markdown file of relative links.

Thanks to [dchest](https://github.com/dchest) for the tidy-up and adding the zip feature, and [matrixik](https://bitbucket.org/matrixik) for his improvements and input.

Installation
--------------
goxc requires the go source and the go toolchain.

 1. [Install go from source](http://golang.org/doc/install/source). (Requires 'hg' and gcc (or MinGW))

 2. Install goxc:

            go get github.com/laher/goxc

Basic Usage
-----------

### Run once

To build the toolchains for all 11 platforms:

       goxc -t

### Now build your artifacts

To build zipped binaries for your app:

	goxc path/to/app/folder

OR

	cd path/to/app/folder
	goxc

### Going further

See 'goxc -h' for more options.

 * e.g. To restrict by OS and Architecture:

	goxc -os=windows -arch=amd64

 * e.g. To set a destination root folder and artifact version number:

	goxc -d=my/jekyll/site/downloads -pv=0.1.1

 * e.g. To output non-zipped binaries into folders:

	goxc -z=false

 * 'Package version' can be compiled into your app if you define a VERSION variable in your main package.


Outcome
-------

By default, artifacts are generated and then immediately zipped into (outputfolder).

e.g. /my/outputfolder/0.1.1/myapp_0.1.1_linux_arm.zip

If you specified the version number -pv=123 then the filename would be myapp_0.1.1_linux_arm_123.zip.

By default, the output folder is ($GOBIN)/(appname)-xc, and the version is 'unknown', but you can specify these.

e.g.

      goxc -pv=0.1.1 -d=/home/me/myapp/ghpages/downloads/


If non-zipped, artifacts generated into a folder structure as follows:

 (outputfolder)/(version)/(OS)_(ARCH)/(appname)(.exe?)

Settings file
-------------

As of v0.2.0, goxc can use a settings file to save and re-run compilations.

To create a config file, just use the -wc (write config) option.

	goxc -d=../site/downloads -os=linux,windows -wc

You can specify an alternative config using -c=configname (default is .goxc)

You shouldn't need to understand the specifics of the config file, but here are the full details for anyone who needs to start using it.

 * goxc looks for files called [configname].json and [configname].local.json
 * If you don't specify a working directory, goxc defaults to current directory, unless you're using -t, when it'll default to your HOME folder. (You can still specify current folder with a simple dot, '.').
 * The .local.json file takes precedence (overrides) over the non-local file.
 * By convention the .local.json file should not be stored in scm (source control e.g. git/hg/svn...)
 * In particular, the .local.json file should store version information for forked repos and unofficial builds.
 * The 'write config' option, -wc, can be used in conjunction with the -c=configname option. -wc does load the (overridable) current config, but ignores content of .local.json files.
 * A simple example of the format can be found in the [goxc code](https://github.com/laher/goxc/blob/master/.goxc.json).
 * An example of what you might put in the [.local.json file](https://github.com/laher/goxc/blob/master/sample-local.json).
 * Don't forget to put '*.local.json' in your scm ignore file.
 * cli flags take precedence over any json file variables.

Limitations
-----------

 * Tested on Linux, Windows (and Mac during an early version). Please test on Mac and *BSD
 * Currently goxc is only designed to build standalone Go apps without linked libraries. You can try but YMMV
 * Bug: issue with config overriding. Empty strings do not currently override non-empty strings. e.g. -pi="" doesnt override the json setting PackageInfo

Todo
----

Contributions welcome via pull requests, thanks. Please use github 'issues' for discussion.

 * Run package's unit tests as part of build? (configurable) gofmt? govet?
 * Bug: issue with config overriding. Empty strings do not currently override non-empty strings. Would involve more involved use of json and flagSet packages.
 * Doc for json config format
 * Option to specify precise dir & name for a particular artifact?
 * Support BuildConstraints to specify platforms.
 * Permit unrecognised platforms (as Golang adds more)
 * Respect +build flags inside file comments (just like 'go build' does)
 * "Copy resources" option for INSTALL, READMEs, LICENSE, configs etc ( ~~Done v0.1.5: for zips.~~ Not done for non-zipped binaries). See [issue 4](https://github.com/laher/goxc/issues/4)
 * Much more error handling and potentially stop-on-error=true flag
 * Refactoring: Utilise/copy from [gotools source](http://golang.org/src/cmd/go/build.go)
 * Refactoring: Start splitting functionality into separate packages, e.g. zipping, build, build-toolchain, config, ...
 * Meaningful godocs everywhere
 * More Unit Tests!!
 * Configurable 'downloads' page: name, format (e.g. markdown,html,ReST,jekyll-markdown), header/footer?
 * Generate 'downloads overview' page (append each version's page as a relative link) ?
 * Artifact types: ~~Done: zip~~, tgz, ...
 * Packaging (source deb & .deb, .srpm & .rpm, .pkg? ...).
 * Improve sanity check: automatically build target toolchain if missing? (need to work out detection mechanism)
 * Improve sanity check: 'download golang source' option?
 * Improve sanity check: warn about non-core libraries and binary dependencies?
 * building .so/.dll shared libraries?
 * Maybe someday: Build plugins (for OS-specific wizardry and stuff)? Pre- and post-processing scripts?
 * Maybe someday: Investigate [forking and ?] hooking directly into the [gotools source](http://golang.org/src/cmd/go/build.go), instead of using os.exec. Fork would be required due to non-exported functions.
 * Maybe someday: Use goroutines to speed up 'goxc -t'
 * Maybe someday: pre- & post-build scripts to run?

Done
----
 * v0.1.0: gofmt, zip archives
 * v0.1.6: Use go/parse package to interpret PKG_VERSION variable and such
 * v0.1.6: Refactoring: use a struct for all the options
 * v0.1.7: Make PKG_VERSION constant name configurable.
 * v0.2.0: Removed PKG_VERSION constant in favour of compiler/linker build flags & main.VERSION variable.
 * v0.2.0: goxc.json file.
 * v0.2.0: take in config filename as argument - using -c
 * v0.2.1: BranchName + PrereleaseInfo + BuildName (to become part of version name)
 * v0.2.2: Removing requirement for <package-folder> argument. Uses current directory if none given.
 * v0.2.2: filling in support for multiple artifact types & multiple tasks (as supported in json config)
 * v0.2.0-0.2.2: Config file for setting up default settings. Preferably json. Support use of local overrides file (my.xxx.json). Similar to Chrome extensions or npm packages? See [issue 3](https://github.com/laher/goxc/issues/3)
 * v0.2.2: write config with -wc
 * v0.3.0: default config for '-t' is now $HOME/.goxc.json. See issue 3 again. A few small API changes cause a minor version increase.
